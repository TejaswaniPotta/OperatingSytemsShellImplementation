# OperatingSytemsShellImplementation

Final project for the course Operating Systems: Interface and Implementation The synopsis of what you can learn from this repository:

A shell program running on an infinite loop printing $ as the prompt
Execution of out of shell commands through APIs (fork, execvp, pipe etc)
Inclusion of redirection "<, >" using proper APIs
Reading of the user input using fgets, parsing them using strkok to split the respective strings using a delimeter "space, | " to execute respective source codes. Additional feature:
Enabling the Change directory command "cd" using a function that helps in the navigation.
This repository should provide a well cemented code of a shell program that could exhibit a shell program exhibiting the nature of an actual shell with few commands included. This repo can be a starting point for someone to start with shell building.
